Got it — restarting. Below is a single, **paste-ready Replit-AI prompt** that describes *exactly* how I want the full Lumio website built: style, pages, interactions, animations, tech stack, assets, sample copy, SEO, and deliverables. Paste this into Replit AI (or any creative/dev assistant) and it will understand the full scope and produce code, assets, or a design system for you.

# Paste-ready Replit AI Prompt — **Build Lumio: full website (React + Tailwind + Framer Motion)**

**Project name:** Lumio — playful streetwear hoodie storefront

**Short summary / elevator pitch (one line):**
Build a bright, playful, Olliepop-inspired ecommerce website for Lumio — a hoodie brand that’s bold, photogenic, and full of joyful micro-animations. The site must be optimized for conversion and mobile-first.

---

## Goals & priorities

1. Launch a complete storefront that includes: Home, Shop, Product, Lookbook, About, Sizing, FAQ, Contact, Cart, and Legal pages.
2. Make the experience *fun, tactile, and highly animated* while preserving accessibility and performance.
3. Provide code deliverables in **React + Tailwind + Framer Motion** (also include optional Shopify Liquid snippets).
4. Provide all copy, image prompts, asset list, and a production-ready folder structure.

## Audience

* Age: 16–28, streetwear-savvy, social-first, loves bold visuals and shareable product shots.

---

## Visual style & brand direction

* **Vibe:** Olliepop-like — bubbly shapes, glossy highlights, sticker-style icons, bold gradients. Playful but premium.
* **Palette:** Citrus yellow `#FFD54A`, Berry magenta `#FF5A9E`, Deep charcoal `#0F1115`, Lavender `#D6C7FF`, Cream `#FFF8F2`. Use neon accents sparingly for CTAs and rim lighting.
* **Typography:** Headline — rounded geometric (Poppins / Inter Rounded). Body — Inter (regular). Large friendly headings.
* **Imagery:** Photorealistic product photos + editorial hero shots (3 models back-facing on rooftop). Use sticker overlays, subtle textures and soft vignettes.
* **Logo usage:** centered, minimal — provide primary SVG and compact favicon.

---

## Required pages & components (deliverable list)

* Home (hero, featured products, lookbook preview, value bullets, newsletter modal)
* Shop (collection filters: color, size; 3-column grid desktop, 1-col mobile)
* Product page (gallery, variants, size picker, price, description, reviews, related products)
* Lookbook (editorial grid, full-screen modals with shop links)
* About (brand story + mission, short team note)
* Sizing guide (visual chart + measurement tips)
* FAQ, Shipping & Returns, Privacy, Terms
* Contact (form + email)
* Floating cart (slideout), sticky nav, sticky checkout CTA on mobile
* Admin-friendly CMS placeholders for copy & images

---

## Motion & interaction system (be specific — copy/paste ready)

**Global rules**

* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
* Use spring physics in Framer Motion for bouncy reveals (stiffness 120, damping 14).
* Micro-interaction timing: 60–90ms (hovers), 300–600ms (entrances), rim sweep 1200–2000ms loop.

**Hero**

* Title types in with subtle wobble (scale 0.98→1.02→1).
* Three-model image slides up with 0.5s stagger and soft bounce.
* Neon rim-light sweep over hoodies every 4–6s (very subtle).
* CTA has breathing glow and micro-jiggle on hover.

**Cards & product tiles**

* Lift on hover (translateY -6px + shadow growth).
* Color swatch expands (scale + rotate) on click for emphasis.
* Price badge flips in on hover.

**Add-to-cart**

* Fly-to-cart animation: clone product image → animate to cart with easing, then play confetti Lottie (6 tiny stars).
* Toast confirms action (slide in bottom-left squishy ease, auto-dismiss 3.5s).

**Page transitions**

* Crossfade + slight slide (0.4s). Use route-based animations with AnimatePresence.

## Functionality & UX requirements

* Mobile-first responsive design.
* Fast load: images lazy-load, use WebP/AVIF, CDN-ready.
* Accessibility: alt text, keyboard nav, visible focus states, color contrast >=4.5:1 for body text.
* Cart persistence (localStorage) and basic checkout flow (simulate with Stripe demo or Shopify buy button).
* Analytics hooks: GA4 + Meta Pixel placeholders.
* Email capture: Klaviyo / Shopify Email integration with a welcome coupon flow.
* Provide a simple mock admin JSON file (products, copy, assets) so non-dev can update content.

---

## Content & copy tone

* Playful, confident, slightly irreverent. Short, snappy lines.
* Hero headline options (choose one):

  * “Light Up Your Day.”
  * “Wear the Vibe.”
  * “Glow Up. Go Out.”
* Product short description template:

  > [Product Name] — heavyweight comfort with a photogenic pop. 350gsm brushed fleece, reinforced seams, true-to-size. Machine wash cold. Free returns.

## Image & asset instructions (include generator prompts)

**Hero image prompt (paste-ready):**

> Three young models (two females, one male) standing side-by-side with their backs turned toward the camera, wearing premium streetwear hoodies branded “Lumio”. Urban rooftop at dusk with skyscrapers, soft rim lighting, subtle neon reflections on the hoodies (citrus & berry accents). Photorealistic, ultra-real 8K, shallow depth of field, professional bokeh, fashion editorial composition, no faces visible, no watermark. Negative prompt: blurry, low-res, watermark, faces visible, cartoonish, extra limbs.

**Product photos needed (per product):** front, back, detail stitching, on-model front, on-model back. Provide mobile crops.
**Other assets:** logo.svg, favicon, 2 short looping hero animations (webm), 12 lookbook images, sticker icons (SVG) for features.

## Tech stack & folder structure (explicit)

* React (Vite)
* Tailwind CSS (JIT)
* Framer Motion
* React Router
* Optional: Stripe (test), Shopify buy SDK (optional)
* Suggested file layout:

```
/src
  /components
    Nav.jsx, Hero.jsx, ProductCard.jsx, Cart.jsx, Footer.jsx
  /pages
    Home.jsx, Shop.jsx, Product.jsx, Lookbook.jsx, About.jsx
  /data
    products.json
  /styles
    globals.css (Tailwind)
  App.jsx
/public
  /images
  favicon.ico
```

---

## Dev deliverables (what to output)

1. Full React app code (components + pages) with Tailwind classes and Framer Motion animations — ready to run.
2. A `/public/images` placeholder list and 1 hero image prompt + 3 product mock prompts.
3. Shopify Liquid equivalents for core templates (home, product, collection).
4. Copy bank (hero lines, product descriptions, email templates, FAQ answers).
5. README with setup steps, env variables, and deployment steps.

---

## Acceptance criteria (how I will judge success)

* Pages render without console errors.
* Animations run smoothly and respect reduced-motion.
* Site is responsive and accessible.
* All copy is present and editable in `products.json`.
* Cart flow is demonstrable (add/remove, view, persistent).

---

## Additional constraints / notes

* Keep bundle small, avoid heavy vendor libs except Framer Motion.
* Provide comments in code for where to swap real payment/analytics keys.
* Prioritize ease-of-editing for non-devs (use `products.json`).
